Description:
Concentration Curls are an isolation dumbbell exercise that targets the biceps.
They are performed (usually) in a seated position and the back of the upper arms is placed against the inside of the thigh.
This wedges the moving arm in place and allows for a fixed, isolated movement that maximises the amount of work that the biceps must do.
