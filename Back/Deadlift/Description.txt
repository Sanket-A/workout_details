Description:
The deadlift focuses on lifting dead weight off the ground to hip level without using momentum to assist the weight on its path up. 
It is known as one of the “big three” exercises for powerlifters which includes squats, bench press, and the deadlift.
 Bodybuilders use the deadlift to promote muscle growth in their entire posterior chain (muscles on the back of the body).
