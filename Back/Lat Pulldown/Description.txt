Description:
The lat pull down is an exercise used to build the muscles of the back. While the exercise will primarily target the lats, you will also notice a fair amount of bicep and middle back activation.
The back is a muscle group that requires a fair amount of variation.
 So, experiment with several different angles and hand positions to maximize your back muscle growth.
