Description:
Pull-ups target your back muscles primarily, specifically your lats, but also your chest and shoulder muscles.
Compared to a chin-up, pull-ups better engage the lower trapezius muscles in your back, between your shoulder blades. 
The overhand grip of the pull-up improves posterior chain activation, says Sobuta. Posterior chain refers to the muscles on the back side of your body, which are key for everyday movements.
