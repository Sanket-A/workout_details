Description:
A dumbbell overhead press, also known as a dumbbell shoulder press,
 is a weightlifting exercise that targets muscles throughout your bodyâ€”including your triceps, glutes, trapezius, and lower back muscles.
 Perform dumbbell overhead presses by getting into a standing position with your feet shoulder-width apart.
 Grab a pair of dumbbells and hold them at shoulder height. Lift the dumbbells overhead, then lower them slowly.
 Repeat this movement for your desired number of repetitions.
