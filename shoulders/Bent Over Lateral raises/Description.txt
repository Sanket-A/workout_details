Description:
 bent-over lateral raise is a brilliant choice if you’re looking to hit your rear deltoids. The change in upper body position means that rather than your lateral deltoids acting as the prime mover, it’s the posterior head of the muscle. This also activates your rhomboids, lower and mid traps, and hamstrings.s
