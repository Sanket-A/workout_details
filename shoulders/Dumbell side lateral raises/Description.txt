Description:
The side lateral raise is an effective shoulder-strengthening movement designed to isolate the lateral head of the deltoid muscle.
 Performed regularly, this can help you develop stronger, broader shoulders.
 All you need is a pair of light dumbbells and enough shoulder flexibility to abduct your arms (lifting the weights out and away from your body) until they form a "T" shape at your shoulders.
