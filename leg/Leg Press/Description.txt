Description:
The leg press machine can come in the form of a horizontal leg press machine or a 45-degree leg press machine. 
Both forms of the leg press machine consist of a platform, free weights placed on top of the platform or weight stacks, and locking mechanisms to hold the platform in place.
The leg press machine promotes lower body development, targeting the major lower body muscles like the quadriceps, hamstrings, gluteal muscles, and calves.
