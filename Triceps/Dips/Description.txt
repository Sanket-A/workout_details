Description:
Dips are a bodyweight exercise that primarily works your chest, shoulders, and triceps. First, your chest (pectoral) muscles work hard as they are the primary mover during this exercise. 
To emphasize your chest even more, lean your torso forward a bit. So your upper body is somewhat hunched over so your chest is nearly parallel to the floor.
