Description:
The dumbbell tricep extension is an exercise used to isolate the muscles of the triceps.
Overhead extension exercises are particularly useful in targeting the long head of the triceps muscle. Having a larger and more dense long head will give you an overall appearance of a larger tricep.
Isolation exercises for the triceps are particularly useful for those looking to achieve aesthetics. They can also be helpful for those looking to increase their strength on other pressing motions.
