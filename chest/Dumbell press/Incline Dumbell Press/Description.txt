Muscles Worked: Upper Chest

Description:
incline dumbbell press is a free weight exercise designed to target the chest, shoulders, and triceps, independently hitting each side of the body.
Unlike the more traditional flat bench press, the incline press shifts the movement's focus to the upper portion of the pectoral muscle groups and the front of the shoulder.
This allows for more significant hypertrophy (muscle growth) of the upper chest when the exercise is performed regularly.
